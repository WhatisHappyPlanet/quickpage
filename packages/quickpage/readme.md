A modern cli for multi page web application powered by vite.js, which is inspired in the situation where some none-framework (or small framework) web pages are needed. We want to manage them in a high efficient way. We want to create it, develop it one by one. Finally, we want to build them on purpose.

Also templates (like svelte, react, preact, vue) are provided to create this tiny and simple multi-page web application.
